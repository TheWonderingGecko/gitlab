        <p>
          As a passionate CS major graduating from the University of
          Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) in 2023, I am dedicated to leveraging my
          skills in web development to create innovative and user-friendly
          solutions. With a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end
          development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
          Node.js), I thrive in collaborative environments and excel at
          translating client requirements into high-quality, scalable
          applications.

      <h2>Education Background</h2>
      <p>
        During my time at UMKC pursuing a CS degree, I had an incredible
        experience that left a lasting impact on my academic and personal
        growth. The professors at UMKC were not only highly knowledgeable in
        their fields but also incredibly insightful. Their passion for computer
        science was contagious, and they consistently provided valuable
        perspectives that challenged and expanded my understanding of the
        subject matter. Moreover, UMKC provided numerous networking
        opportunities that allowed me to connect with professionals in the tech
        industry. These connections proved to be invaluable, as they opened
        doors to internships, job opportunities, and mentorships. Through these
        experiences, I gained a deeper understanding of the industry and made
        lasting connections with like-minded individuals. Additionally, the CS
        program at UMKC exposed me to a wide range of new experiences. From
        participating in exciting research projects to engaging in collaborative
        coding challenges, I was constantly pushed to think critically, solve
        problems, and adapt to new technologies. Overall, my time at UMKC was an
        enriching journey that equipped me with the necessary skills, insights,
        and network to thrive in the ever-evolving field of computer science.
